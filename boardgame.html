            <li>Summary: King Robert Baratheon is dead, and the lands of Westeros brace for
              battle. Can you claim the Iron Throne? Designed for ages 14 and up,
              A Game of Thrones: The Board Game Second Edition is a classic game
              of warfare, diplomacy, and intrigue for three to six players.
              Taking control of the well-known characters from George R.R.
              Martin's beloved fantasy Series, players must fight for dominance
              of the realm. Will you take power through force, coerce your way

              your side? With opportunities for strategic planning, masterful
              diplomacy, and clever card play, this game gives you a host of
              ways to spread your influence over Westeros. </li>
